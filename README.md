# Chat-With-Multiple-PDF-Documents-With-LangChain-And-Google-Gemini-Pro
Developed an application leveraging Google's Gemini Pro model and Langchain library to implement a Language Model (LLM). This application allows users to input multiple PDF documents, which are processed using FAISS vector embeddings for analysis and retrieval.
The FAISS vector embeddings facilitate efficient storage and retrieval of textual information from the PDF documents. The Gemini Pro model is utilized for conversational question-answering tasks, providing detailed responses based on the provided context and user queries. This application enables users to interactively engage with the content of the PDF documents, extracting relevant information and obtaining answers to their questions in a conversational manner.
